# SSH Tunnel
I have lost touch with remote sites for the last time... and setting up phone-home connections is the best way to prevent me from getting locked out ever again.
This project is extremely simple and follows the same type of setup as my other projects.


# Installation
I wanted a few very simple installations to get things working, so here they are:

>$ wget https://github.com/danielheth/ssh-tunnel/tarball/master

>$ tar -xpvf master

>$ cd danielheth*

>$ sudo ./install.sh

Then follow the prompts which will help you configure the ssh tunnel to connect into your target host.
